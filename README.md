# CAT

A keyboard mouse.

Cross Aiming Tool if you need it to be an acronym :-) \
The goal is to minimize the use of a mouse, not to eradicate mice. \
Intended usecase is to be able to keep the hands on the keyboard while writing. \
Therefore dragging and scrolling is not supported.

Use "asdw" or arrow-keys to choose direction.

When the rhombe is small enough (8 key presses) \
or when "e" is pressed, the mousepointer is placed \
where the lines cross in the center of the rhombe \
and the mouse is clicked.
\
\
To right-click press "r" instead of "e".
\
\
Press "q" to reset rhombes.

To start using a hot key on \
Ubuntu 18.04: Download the cat_ubuntu standalone file and place it somewhere. \
Go to Settings, Devices, Keyboard and scroll to the bottom to of \
the list of shortcuts. Press + and add a shortcut. I use shift + ctrl + u. \
The Command should be the path to cat_ubuntu (Eg /home/user/Desktop/cat_ubuntu)
