# CAT

A keyboard mouse.

Cross Aiming Tool if you need it to be an acronym :-) \
The goal is to minimize the use of a mouse, not to eradicate mice. \
Intended usecase is to be able to keep the hands on the keyboard while writing. \
Therefore dragging and scrolling is not supported.

Use "asdw" or arrow-keys to choose direction.

When the rhombe is small enough (8 key presses) \
or when "e" is pressed, the mousepointer is placed \
where the lines cross in the center of the rhombe \
and the mouse is clicked.
\
\
To right-click press "r" instead of "e".
\
\
Press "q" to reset rhombes.

To start using a hot key on \
*Ubuntu 18.04:* Download the _cat_ubuntu_ standalone file and place it in a folder somewhere. \
Open a terminal, go to the folder and change the program to executable with the command _chmod 555 cat._ \
Go to Settings, Devices, Keyboard and scroll to the bottom to of \
the list of shortcuts. Press + and add a shortcut. I use _shift + ctrl + u._ \
The Command should be the path to _cat_ubuntu_ (Eg /home/user/Desktop/cat_ubuntu)

*Windows 10:* Download the _cat_win10_ folder and place it somewhere. \
Go into the folder in the file explorer and make a shortcut by right-clicking on the program *cat* \
Move the shortcut to the Desktop, right-click the shortcut and add a keyboard shortcut. I use _shift + ctrl + u._
