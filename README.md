# CAT

A keyboard mouse.

Cross Aiming Tool if you need it to be an acronym :-)

Use "asdw" or arrow-keys to choose direction.

When the rhombe is small enough (8 key presses) \
or when "e" is pressed, the mousepointer is placed \
where the lines cross in the center of the rhombe \
and the mouse is clicked.
\
\
To right-click press "r" instead of "e".
\
\
Press "q" to reset rhombes.
